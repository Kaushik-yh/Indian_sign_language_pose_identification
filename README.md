# Machine Learning based translator with Sign Language to text conversion and vice-a-versa for hearing-impaired individuals.
## Introduction
Human society is plagued with many physical and mental disabilities, one such disability is the loss of hearing. India is reported to have sixty three million Individuals are hearing-impaired. 

This study focus on developing a deep neural network model to bridge the communication gap between the general society and the hearing impaired people. 
  * The first part of the project focuses on developing a classification algorithm to identify the English words when the input is a sign pose video.
  * The second part of the project involves conversion of English word to it's respective sign pose using an Animation software.

Thereby developing a complete translation software that can identify human pose gestures and translate it to English using Machine Learning techniques, and convert selected English words into human pose representation. This experiment is performed using the Indian Sign Language as the dataset.
